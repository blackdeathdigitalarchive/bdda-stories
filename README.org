* bdda-stories
  The purpose of this repository is to collect user stories that will inform the development of the BDDA.

  - Check the current set of user stories before creating a new one.  If a similar story has already been written, add comments to it rather than creating a new one.
  - Use reasonably short titles, but repeat any information in the title in the initial comment (the title may be changed later).
  - Feel free to use the tradition user story template ("As a role, I want goal/desire so that benefit") or a use case style as you see fit. Include links to any useful examples or supporting material.
